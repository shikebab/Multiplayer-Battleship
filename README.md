# Multiplayer-Battleship
This is a multiplayer adaptation of the battleship game implemented in Java. It is built on the 1990 Milton Bradley version of the game. The rules of the game can be read here:

The program allows for an unlimited number of players, but the game board is a 10 by 10 grid. Each player has 5 different types of ships (for which I have used an enumeration):
CARRIER, BATTLESHIP, CRUISER, DESTROYER and SUBMARINE with spaces of 5,4,3,3 and 2 respectively. 
The game ends when ships of only 1 player remain on the board and other ships have been eliminated.
